## Case study 3

The data are the same as in case study #2.

The Derivation Model goes further and integrates the use of `Scale` vocabulary as well as multiple geometric transformations (defined with `cvkr:transformOperation`) allowing a "filled" representation of the ProbableLocationArea at low zoom levels, and a reversed representation at high zoom levels.

This effectively shows where is the area of interest (the ProbableLocationArea) at a low zoom level, and does not obstruct the visibility of items within that area at a high zoom level.

Also, at this high zoom level, we display the ReferenceObject used as target for the clues given by the victim.  
By interpreting the map, at a high zoom level, one can see the path to which the victim referred and, on either side, two objects that can be used to question the victim. The direction of the slope between the peak, the path, and the watercourse is also clearly visible. This information can be used by the rescuer to question the victim.
